# Polynomial-Regression

Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the independent variable x and dependent variable y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial. Polynomial regression fits a nonlinear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y, denoted E(y |x)

A simple python program that implements a very basic Polynomial Regression on a small dataset. The matplotlib.pyplot library is used to draw a graph to visually represent the the polynomial regression model.
